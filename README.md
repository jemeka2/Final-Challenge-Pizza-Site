**ASSIGNMENT**

_Create an online pizza ordering system like[ &pizza's (Links to an external site.)](https://order.andpizza.com/menu/gaithersburg)._

_To build their pizza, the user should be able to select:_



* _A dough type_
* _Sauce_
* _Cheese_
* _Veggies_
* _Protein_
* _Toppings/Finishing touches_

_There should be a blank pizza image to start off with when the user is building their pizza and for each topping the user selects, those toppings should show up on that pizza image. To see an implementation of this, check out[ Papa John's (Links to an external site.)](https://www.papajohns.com/order/builder/productBuilderInfo?productGroupId=cyo&productSKU.sku=1-1-4-83&quantity=1) online ordering system when building a custom pizza._

_Each pizza should start off with a base price (one dough type, one sauce, one cheese and two toppings). Additional toppings should be calculated and added to the base price._

_Upon submission, generate an itemized receipt with the user's selections and cost of each additional topping (if applicable)._

_The date/time of the order should also be captured._

_Users can either log into their account to place and order or create an account upon checking out. Users should be able to see a list of their order history when logged into their accounts._

_Users should be notified by text message (use Twilio) or by email once their order has been submitted._

_Reports to generate by the admin:_



* _A list of all customers_
* _Top 3 pizza toppings_
* _Total sales_
* _Find a customer by name_

_Admins should also have the ability to add/remove pizza toppings from the ordering system._
